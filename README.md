## 📖 About The Project

The **RAG Research Assistant** is a next-generation tool designed to help researchers, students, and professionals interact with their documents in a smarter way. By leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, this application allows you to upload PDF documents and ask complex questions, receiving accurate, context-aware answers in real-time.

Unlike standard chatbots, this assistant grounds its responses directly in the content of your uploaded files, ensuring reliability and relevance for your specific research needs.

### Key Features

- **📄 Smart PDF Analysis**: Upload multiple research papers or documents and instantly index them for querying.
- **💬 Context-Aware Chat**: Engage in a natural conversation with your data. The AI "reads" your documents to provide precise answers.
- **⚡ Real-Time Streaming**: Experience a seamless chat interface with typewriter-style streaming responses.
- **🎨 Modern & Responsive UI**: A beautiful, distraction-free interface built with the latest web technologies, featuring dark mode support.
- **💾 Persistent Sessions**: Your chat history is saved automatically, so you never lose track of your research insights.
