      "content": "### **1. Clear Answer**\nThe **core difference** between **VGGNet** and **AlexNet** lies in their **convolutional layer design** and **depth**:\n\n- **AlexNet** (2012) used **larger convolutional filters** (e.g., 11\u00d711, 5\u00d75) and **fewer layers** (8 convolutional + 3 fully connected).\n- **VGGNet** (2014) introduced **smaller 3\u00d73 convolutional filters** consistently throughout the network, **stacking them** to increase depth (e.g., VGG-16 with 13 convolutional layers, VGG-19 with 16 convolutional layers).\n- VGGNet demonstrated that **deep and narrow networks (using 3\u00d73 filters) outperform shallow and wide ones** (like AlexNet) while requiring fewer parameters than larger filters.\n\n### **2. Key Points**\n- **Filter Size**:\n  - AlexNet used **larger filters** (e.g., 11\u00d711, 5\u00d75).\n  - VGGNet used **only 3\u00d73 filters**, stacked to achieve the same receptive field with fewer parameters.\n- **Depth vs. Width**:\n  - AlexNet was **shallower but wider** (larger filters).\n  - VGGNet was **deeper and narrower** (more 3\u00d73 filters, fewer parameters).\n- **Performance**:\n  - VGGNet\u2019s deep, narrow architecture **improved accuracy** in ImageNet while being more computationally efficient than AlexNet\u2019s larger filters.\n- **Implementation**:\n  - VGGNet was built using **Caffe** (a deep learning framework) with modifications for multi-GPU training.\n\n### **3. Main Source**\nThe answer is primarily derived from **[Source 1 & 4] (VGGNet.pdf, Pages 0 & 1)**.\n- **Source 1** explains the **Network-in-Network** influence and VGG\u2019s **3\u00d73 convolution strategy**.\n- **Source 4** explicitly compares **VGGNet\u2019s 3\u00d73 filters** to **AlexNet\u2019s larger filters** and confirms the **deep vs. shallow** trade-off advantage.",
